# AWS Lambda: Function vs Application

Understanding the distinction between a **Lambda Function** and a **Lambda Application** is crucial when designing scalable, serverless solutions on AWS.

## ‚úÖ What is a Lambda Function?

A **Lambda Function** is the core unit in AWS Lambda. It represents a single, independent block of code that executes in response to an event. It is **stateless**, **short-lived**, and typically performs one well-defined task.

### Key Components:
- **Handler**: Entry point of the code.
- **Runtime**: Environment (Python, Node.js, etc.).
- **Trigger**: Event source (e.g., S3, API Gateway).
- **Permissions**: IAM roles and policies.

### Example Use Cases:
- Resize an image on S3 upload.
- Send an email notification.
- Validate user input for an API.

## üèóÔ∏è What is a Lambda Application?

A **Lambda Application** is a collection of AWS resources (including one or more Lambda functions) that work together as a unified system. These applications are often managed using **AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model)** or **CloudFormation**.

### Components Can Include:
- Multiple Lambda Functions
- S3 Buckets
- DynamoDB Tables
- API Gateway Endpoints
- IAM Roles and Policies
- EventBridge Rules or Step Functions

### Example Use Case:
An image processing application that:
1. Accepts uploads via API Gateway.
2. Stores them in S3.
3. Triggers a Lambda function to resize images.
4. Saves resized images to another bucket.
5. Logs actions to DynamoDB.

## üöÄ Summary

| Use a **Lambda Function** when: |
|-------------------------------|
| - You have a small, isolated task. |
| - You don't need to manage complex dependencies. |
| - You‚Äôre quickly prototyping. |

| Use a **Lambda Application** when: |
|-----------------------------------|
| - You‚Äôre deploying multiple interrelated AWS resources. |
| - You want to manage infrastructure as code. |
| - You‚Äôre building production-ready systems. |
